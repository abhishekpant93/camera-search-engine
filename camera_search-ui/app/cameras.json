It is fairly expensive thing to buy online...the delivery was late, i had to call 15 times and the support had no clue to where the shipment was..they just read the track information back to you.Moreover it is about 550$ more expensive online than waht you can buy in shop for..thats a cool 35,000 Rs less. with all warranties etc. Great Camera..but buy it at a better place.",

               "body":"I gave a lot of thought while choosing a beginner DSLR and shortlisted two-one from each of the biggies. Canon 600D and Nikon D3200. Each has its own advantages and finally I came up with a few things that I felt are really significant. Here they are!1. Nikon's C-MOS is around 10% bigger than Canon's, It's just enough to understand that sensor is equivalent to film in the yester year cameras and the bigger the sensor, the more the detail and better the image.2. Nikon has got more Megapixels. Don't get me wrong, One of the best and costliest cameras Nikon D4 has got a sensor resolution of (only?) 16.2 MP and I don't dare say that D3200 is a match for it. I'm just saying that bigger sensor and better resolution in D3200 compared to 600D (esp when we do a lot of cropping) inclined me towards it.3. D3200 has more auto-focus points (11 vs 9) that aid in better tracking in AF-Area dynamic mode, has slightly better frame rate (4 vs 3.7), much lesser start up time, better weighs lighter.4. Auto-focus during video recording.5. Most importantly Nikon has a much cheaper price tag.1. Canon 600D has articulating LCD screen means that the screen isn't fixed-very useful when using Live mode when subjects is at low/ ground level. Nikon has a fixed one.2. Canon has found to deliver better performance at really high ISOs (less noise) as per one website which I religiously follow but nevertheless I rarely use really higher ISOs so as to pick on the noise.3. Canon has in-built auto focus motor but many of the recent Nikkor lenses come with foucs motor, so I didn't feel it's such a big issue.4. 600D has a better LCD screen, it better resembles the final image and also a bigger viewfinder.I weighed my choices and finally went ahead with Nikon and it never disappointed me.Finally I was really awed by Amazon's packing!",

               "body":"I bought this camera for 33k in June 2012, since then, 30 months has passed, and the price has dropped to 23k.--------------------------------------------Comparing this to the Canon 600D:--------------------------------------------The 600D has a flippy screen. But mind you, you can easily damage the flippy screen. Happened to me in all flippy screen cameras including the D5200.It has a 10% smaller sensor, effectively making it a 1.6x crop factor sensor, as opposed to all other brands' APS-C cameras who have a 1.5x crop factor sensors. I don't know why they still carry forward this tradition, it handicaps every APS-C sensor by making them smaller compared to others. It has only 18MP, so pixel pitch is around 4.3m, where as the D3200 has a pixel pitch of 3.85m. In spite of this, the overall high ISO quality is better than the Canon, maybe because the Nikon sensor is a newer 2012 model[2.5 years old at time of writing], whereas the Canon sensor in over 6 years old.Both have decent 1080p video. The D3200 is a tad bit faster though, cranking out 4fps as opposed to 3.7.Its currently retailing at ~32k in Amazon, but I'm sure you can get it for a lesser rate at your local dealer, but its still not going to be anywhere near what you can get the D3200 for. Should be able to get it for 20-22k if you try hard enough.The button configuration of the 600D is similar to the D5200, but the menus layout is different from the Nikon.Battery life is a bit better on the Nikon, I've been able to squeeze out ~4000 shots out of two batteries which I carried with me.But you got to disable image review, and auto info display when you half press the shutter button.------------------------------------Comparison with the D5200:------------------------------------The D5200 is a bit better than the D3200 in focusing. But both cameras are still unreliable. All 39 points are no use when it comes to taking portraits, where the camera will focus on whatever is nearest. Its center focus point is similar to the D3200 in focusing. I cannot imagine tracking subjects with either cameras, so I only use them on AF-S mode.But one difference which I saw was the ability to increase the ISO in 1/3rd stops. In the D3200 we can only increase it in single stops, ie 100>200>400>800 and so on as opposed to 100>130>160>200> and so on. I think its faster this way, because there's only one dial for changing ISO and shutter speed on the D3200/D5200.D3200 shoots in 12 bit RAW, whereas D5200 shoots in 14 bit RAW. 20-25MB vs 25-30MB file size difference. High ISO is about 1/3rd of a shot cleaner in the D3200 as well.But is it worth 10k more than the D3200? The answer is no, I would pick the D3200 over the D5200, and get myself the 35mm or 50mm 1.8G for the price difference. Because there is no compelling advantage the D5200 offers over the D3200. On the contrary I consider the D3200 to be better built because of the absence of the flippy screen, since the D5200 screwed up on me several times. It could be good for video though.-------------------------------------------About my impression of the D3200:Overall, the D3200 is a very reliable piece of equipment for what its worth. Shot ~100k frames with it, and you can rely on it because its behavior is more or less fixed. Doesn't act on its own unlike other cameras like the flippy screened D5200 and the 600D. Does exactly what you intend without much fuss. If you have a bigger budget, consider the D7000 over the D5200/5300/5500, as its a much better camera.-------------------------------------------Nikon Service Review: I hate Nikon Service Centers. They're frustratingly slow unless you're NPS, and charge you ridiculous amounts for even opening and servicing anything even though there might not be any damage. I hope I'll upgrade my status to NPS in the future, until then, its a long and rough road ahead for me dealing with Nikon Service.Trivia: This camera doesn't have any lens calibration system, so AF irregularities with fast primes must be sorted by service centers within the first 2 years of purchase. I forgot this, since it isn't the only body I use, and my warranty has run out. I had to shell out ~3k for both body, and lens calibration.It also doesn't have weather sealing, like the D5200 and 600D, so you can expect condensation inside the viewfinder and on the lens elements when you move from an chilled room, to the outside where the humidity and temperature may differ.",

So please bear with me!!!Ordered on the 6th of June and got it on the 10th.Here's the timelineAmazon carefully packed it with airbags to prevent it from coming to any harm as the lenses and the camera very prone to damages in transit. FedEx did an exceptional job delivering the package.Opening the outer box you would be drawn to the camera box and the beautiful leather bag in it.It took me a while to find the 8gb memory card which was taped on to the side of the camera box. So you need eagle eyes!!!The box was sealed with the Nikon logo and on opening you will find the camera, len and other accessories neatly packed in air bubble packs.If you are a novice to the world of photography, I suggest read the manual and go through the instructions before operating the camera.Coming to the camera its really compact in size and offers a beautiful display of 3inch. Since I am writing this review after only a day I am not able to access all the features of the camera but by reading the manual I clicked some good shots.A prime lens and a 70-300mm is what you will be needing in the future. Till then keep clicking.Don't forget to validate your warranty card in the Nikon Authorised Service Facility for your 2 yrs warranty.Amazon offers this product at a price lower than other online sites.

Great image quality2. Low noise at high ISOs. I generally don't see any noise till ISO 3200, but even at ISO 6400, noise is minimum and can generally be removed using DXO 93. Continuous shooting is nice. I can shoot indefinitely at around 2-3fps (RAW) using a Sandisk 90Mbps card4. Battery life is good. I can easily get by with one full day even with a Dawmtech GPS module attached. However, for people who want to get a second battery, I suggest them to get the EN-EL14A instead, as it provides more shots per charge5. In Camera HDR is more of a gimmick. It doesn't account for movement between shots and the resulting Dynamic Range isn't quite high. Better to manually bracket shots at -2,0,+2 and use a software like Photomatix for HDR.",

After going through millions of reviews and youtube videos on the internet I decided to go with Nikon d5200, And I am really happy that I made the right decision. I was a novice who had no knowledge of Dslr photography what so ever. But the UI (User Interface) of this camera is so amazing that even a semi literate person can operate it easliy. Coming to specs, this cam beats the specs of even costlier Nikon and Canon Dslrs. It has 39 focal points( Which is available only on High end Nikon and Canon dslrs, >70k) which is a greatest advantage of this dslr, You can literally focus at any corner of your screen!! I don't know whether pixels matter in DSLR but it is 24.1 MP !!! that amazing.I have been using for a month now, and I had been to Western Ghats for good photography (With my Nikon 70-300 mm lens). The cam produced some of the best images you can ever imagine. I started feeling that I was a pro at this :D. Since I wanted to capture those precious moments of animals and birds, its very important to have a better frames per second shots in your cam and nikon d5200 beats even some of the high end camera in this aspect. It has 5 fps which is really really helpful when your photographing in the wild.The rotating screen is also a very good advantage to have in your camera when you are photographing at awkward angles,Which the nikon d5200 has.These were some of the features that I as a novice felt really useful.I'd like to add that the D5200 is Nikons Finest camera for independent film making in this or the Full Frame sensor classes. This camera is able to out perform its rivals in low light environments. Its able to provide excellent images at 1920 x 1080p (60, 50, 30, 25, 24 fps).All in all, this dslr is probably the best return of investment deal that I have made so far. This is undoubtedly one of the best dslrs in the market for beginners and mid level photographers.!! chao !! :)",

Ergonomics wise I feel very good in my hands.They have upgraded to 9 cross type auto focus points compared to 1 in previous one.Video quality has been improved and in manual mode one can control ISO and shutter speed with ease.New feature of using it with WR-R10 will be a plus point to those who want wireless.Megapixel has been upgraded from 16mp to 24mp though I am not a pixel peeper..In nut and shell I can say that it has stolen most of the qualities of D7000 that includes 39 autofocus. Ofcource at this price no company would give you a metal body with prosumer grade dslr qualities .Cons:The Kit Lens 18-55 is a waste for money.The strap supplied is not up to the mark",

I had started out in the lookout for an advanced poinnt and shoot, almost finalized Sony HX400V a day and Fujifilm HS50SX the other day, but then decided to go for a DSLR, and a DSLR is a DSLR. Just dont think and go for it. You will love whatever you click. Flip out screen is a handy feature and so i would suggest you to go for 5XXX series instead of 3XXX series. Research as much as you can so that your purchase becomes 'your' decision. Nikon low light sensitivity is superb, camera bag provided is really good. I have handled canon 600D as well, so want to clarify the myth about Canon being more user friendly UI. Nikon's interface I found to be equally easy, just needed a couple of days to get used to it.One strong recommendation which I can make only now after owning D5200 -Buy D5100 instead of D5200, its coming for 23K now, and invest in a prime or telephoto lens. My photographer friends have D5100 and I am at least a year away from taking pictures as good as they click, so its about where you stand and what you click. A better camera does not make you a better photographer.Hope you make the best choice and most importantly 'are satisfied' with it.Happy shopping...Happy shooting :)amznJQ.onReady('jQuery', function() {amznJQ.available('popover', function() {var widgetDom = jQuery(\"#RD4N9AJT0QIPQ_imageSection_E460AE74-E292-11E4-9B1C-9431377E014D\");var images = widgetDom.find(\".review-image-thumbnail\");for (var c=0;c<images.length;c++) {var imageURL = jQuery(images[c]).attr(\"large-image-url\");jQuery(images[c]).amazonPopoverTrigger({showOnHover:true,literalContent: '<img src=\"'+ imageURL +'\" style=\"max-width:100%;max-height:100%;\">'});}});});",

               "body":"Excellent camera.  Earlier I was using D3100 with 18-55mm lens; being dissatisfied with the performance of the lens, ordered 35mm prime lens.  Then the performance was good, although I was not satisfied as the noise in low light condition is high and pixels were not much clear as I expected.  Then I have used my elder brother's camera (D5100), which has captured more than 50,000 images, and made a comparison with D5100, it was excellent.  I had decided to sell D3100 with 18-55mm lens, and decided as well to buy D5100 with 18-55mm lens.  After selling the earlier camera, I was confused between D5100 vs. D3300.  One of my friends suggested me to buy any camera of D5000 series.  I have order D5200 with 18-55 VR-II, and I am satisfied with picture quality, clear pixels, excellent colours, looking better, better screen resolutation, HDR, various D-light options, low noise in low light.  If any one ask me for suggestion, I would suggestion D5100, because it has excellent picture quality and you can save Rs.10,000/-.  If you insert a fast memory card, you can get fast saving of images by the camera, whether it has Expeed- 2, 3, 4.",

               "body":"The camera takes very good pictures.Having spent a lot of time in research, let me answer a few questions.1. No difference between Nikon and Canon. Both have parallel models in each price range. But you can avoid Canon 1200D. It doesn't have auto sensor cleaning.2. At this price range, buy Canon if you have access to a lot of old canon lenses which don't have an in-lens focus motor. (Unlike Canon, Nikon entry-level cameras do not have a focus motor in the body).3. If the above is not the case, then don't narrow your options to a single manufacturer. I bought Nikon because all my friends have Nikon and between us, we have a lot of lenses we can exchange. Most new lenses come with in-lens focus motors.4.  Autofocus speed is more a function of the lens itself, rather than your Camera's autofocus system.5. Buy the camera giving you the best discounted price and save your money for buying lenses.6. You will need to buy a 35mm prime and a 55-200mm VR lens to get your hobby going. So keep money aside for that and don't spend all your money on the body.7. In the low-cost range, buy only Nikon/ Canon lenses and avoid third party lenses for your Nikon/Canon camera.8. Super zoom lenses like 18-200mm will always have flaws at their limits.9./If this is going to be your second DSLR, buy semi pro camera like D7000/7100 or Canon equivalents. (But these will be bulky cameras).10. Happy shooting!",

Nice job Sellar and Amazon.Great Camera. There are tons of reviews out there so I won't repeat the tired clich. Been playing around with it for two days. This is my first camera. The camera is only as good as the photographer and its overwhelmingly good for any newbie out there so no issues there. Its the best for this price in the market. The latest version D5300 have 2-3 new features, but I don't think its worth the extra INR 10-12k.Only some small annoying things which Nikon could improve on:1. Can use manual focus while lens locked in AF mode. Have to change the switch position of the AF/M button. Really annoying. It should allow for manual focus even with the switch is in AF selection.2. Bag provided is not good enough. Its belt is too short, feels like ladies purse. Inner space is enough for camera + 2 lenses. Two outer pockets seem inadequate though.3. Camera strap doesn't feel good enough. Could be better.4. Battery charger is too big, but without a wire. But the plug attachment on is not easy to remove and with it attached the charger doesn't fit in the small pockets of the bag. Little annoying I thought.",

Awesome product. Great Result.. I recommend personally. \"This is not entry level.. \" This is a semi professional camera.. Can be used for Shortfilms too. so no needs to worry about quality and all. Kit lens works perfectly.. looking for the next level of 18-104 or 18-135 or 55-200 mm len. you will come to know later why 18 mm?(for wide) . What ever the camera you buy, the picture , it depends how we shoot.. so no matter costly/worthy , its our hand to produce great pics.. only camera will not produce great images , the yway you look an object is matter as well as a software which helps to enhance your coloring , to be viewed the pics..All the best for beginners..

               "body":"Great Camera. Great service by Amazon! I was in two minds between the D610 and the D7100 due to budget constraints and overall performance of both (not considering sensor size) and can safely say this was worth the extra money. The camera is a rugged, sharp and precise piece of equipment that will be my primary imaging device for the next few years.I upgraded from a D3100 so it was a step up on too many levels. Having said that, I took this camera to an extremely challenging rain-forest expedition right out of the box with 6 days of shooting in pouring rain, leaving the camera fully drenched, mostly without any rain protection or umbrella; and this thing just kept shooting without any glitches. Auofocus performance is great, but a little weak in poor lighting.Pros: 1. Great build and finish. Feels solid and rugged.  2. Controls can require some getting used to, but is user friendly  3. Amazing dynamic range and very low noise at high ISO  4. Timelapse, HDR, bracketing, multi-exposure and many other advanced functionality  5 Kickass battery performance  6. U1/U2 settingsDid I mention the obvious - Sheer brilliant image quality. :)Cons: 1. Low light lens hunt  2. No CF card slot  3. Slow shutter speed  (1/4000 of a second, but really doesn't matter)  4. Shorter than expected buffer capacityConclusion:  The camera is worth every penny spent. The eventual upgrade from APS-C to 35mm sensors itself is a huge upgrade. The camera also has its fair share of bad press due to the D600's oil/dust spot issues, but one needs to look through highly opinionated forums and famous camera reviewers who share a lot of their bias and propaganda. The Nikon D610 was able to take on 5 days of the worst usage in the wettest rain-forests of India, thorough horrid light conditions, abuse and rain; and in-spite of this was able to deliver great image quality and prove its rugged worth. This one gets a 5 stars from me, just for the product.Delivery from Amazon required followup and was delivered right after. There were also no accessories provided (bag/SD-card) apart from the box, but then again for the price that I managed to bag this deal was an achievement in itself. The lowest price for the D610 ever. 5 stars to the vendor and Amazon as well. :)CheersAtul Haldankar",

Amazon decided to use a much bigger external box filled with lots of air bags so that the delivery person will take extra care (because of the 4-time as big package size).D610 is one of the best in Nikon lineage (and best in its category). One can find hoards of reviews in other sites.The pricing was very competitive, much lesser than the US prices, and other on-line prices. I also ordered (and received) a 24-70 f2.8 through Amazon to go with D610, which was also quite a deal (compared to the US prices, and that quoted in other on-line stores).To get the best out of these modern sensors (both full-frame and DX Cameras), please get a new lens also.

               "body":"Got this awesome camera at a awesome price from Amazon. Thank you very much Amazon.Regarding the camera it's the best DX format camera you can get. Look at the Nikon timeline in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Nikon_DSLR_cameras). Forget about D5200 or D5300 even if they claim to have a better sensor (Which is just a gimmick, you won't notice any difference), they lack professional controls. D7000 is the best Semi-Pro camera in this price range. U will get superb photo qualities at higher ISO.Pros:1. Kit lens is 18-105mm which has a market price around 17k and it has a superb optical quality unlike 18-55 mm (Even if you buy cheaper body like D5200 with this lens would cost more than what amazon offering for D7000 + Lens)2. AF motor inbuilt, so if you buy cheaper lens without AF motor (ex: 50mm 1.8D Prime Nikkor) the autofocus functionality would work perfectly. If you use D5200 or D5300 either you have to mannually focus or buy costly lens with AF motor built in.3. Has two memory card slots, one can be used for back ups.4. Plenty of buttons provided for controlling different settings directly like ISO, Apperture, metering mode etc. which comes very handy while taking shots.Cons:1. I have been using it for one month and I haven't found any cons of this camera, Only one thing I would like to mention that the camera is bit heavier than lower end DSLR models as it is build of Magnesium Alloy. But the weight of the camera also comes handy when you are using a heavy lens (like 70-300 mm VR), it helps to maintain stability while holding the lens. Try to carry the camera in a backpack.Regarding the warranty - Nikon recently posted in their web site that online sellers are not authorised Nikon reseller. I would like to mention that Amazon is a marketplace not a seller, when my camera arrived I checked the invoice, it was sold by \"J.J. Mehta & Sons\", I checked the Nikon website and found that the seller is a Nikon Authorised seller ar Mumbai. I registered my camera and lens at Nikon website and asked them if it has the 2 year Nikon India warranty, and they replied positively. :D Also I asked them that my warranty card is not stamped, Do I have to get it stamped, they replied that as I have bought it from a Nikon authorized seller there is no need to stamp it. :)",

Bag is quite good. Don't know why some complained about it. But the bag is fit for the camera and one extra lens only.Took some pictures with both 18-105mm and 55-200mm lens. At a first glance the pictures are ok. Charged the battery overnight (8 hrs) before first use. The camera feels a bit heavy initially. But I think with time this will be ok. Camera has a good grip. Changing the lenses is easy.The camera feels real pro. Compared with D5300 and D90 before buying. It is good as a first DSLR. But it will also provide opportunities to advanced amateurs.

Thought of a D7100, but bought this as I got an amusing deal from Amazon!Those who are confused about buying D3300 and D5300, go ahead with D3300 without a second thought, you don't need to spend extra 20K for a Fully articulated LCD, otherwise they are the same. The so called more auto-focus points in D5300 helps in nothing, you'll know after you use!You'll find tons of reviews and user guides for D7100 in internet....When comparing, most people often forget that Nikon D7000 has a weather-shield, which is almost a must for wildlife photography.",

Their build doesn't look so great, but it's something about the colors from a Canon, which seem to just pop.Another piece of advise; Don't blindly go for the kit lens. Do a decent amount of research and pick the body and the lens separately if necessary. A good prime lens, despite all it's drawbacks, can, at the end of the day give you a picture which a kit lens never can.",

Here is a quick comparison.The D5100 is superior to the Canon D600 in almost all respects. One major reason to go for the Nikon over Canon is the auto focus motor is built-in the lens rather than the camera body. Yes this makes the lens more expensive but it makes a good difference as per my research to have the AF motor in the lens.D3200 (D3300 also) is extremely close to the D5100 but only reason to not go for the D3200 though it is the newer model is that it does not have the flip screen which I fell is extremely necessary. I have used flip as well as fixed screens in the past and I know how valuable it is to have a flip screen. Though the D3200 has more megapixel than the D5100 it barely makes a difference in the picture quality. In fact the D5100 has a slightly larger sensor size than the D3200 which does make a difference and covers up the megapixel gap.D5200 is slightly better than the D5100 but not so much better to pay the huge price difference. However the D5100 has a slightly larger sensor size, longer battery life and it is slightly smaller. For the price difference of 11-12k I can get a good prime lens.In terms of lens for the D5100, I went for the Tamron 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 XR Di II LD Aspherical IF Macro Zoom Lens which gives me the flexibility to shoot close ups as well as zoom without having to change the lens every time. Will invest in a prime lens as and when I feel the need. For now loving and enjoying the awesome pictures with my D5100 with the Tamron 18-200mm lens.Cheers!!Nelson",

Light weight & compact- Carrying dslr is pain in the ____. So D5100 is both compact & light weight as compare to D7000 and D7100. This is super important IMHO, you'll definitely going to enjoy this advantage.3. ISO settings are not limited unlike canon's 550D(Dumb).4. Far better build & picture quality than canon. Just pick up any nikon lens and you'll notice huge difference immediately.5. Amazing low light photography. Just freaking AMAZING.CONS- 1. None so far, speed could have been better but who cares for few millisecond.Tip- Get 35mm lens instead of 18-55mm and see the huge improvement in photography. Don't waste your money on D5200 & D5300, just get the good lenses.",

However, i have good hands-on experience with quite a lot of PS cameras and few DSLRs (both Canon as well as Nikon). There is no point in arguing where Canon or Nikon is better, because both makes better cameras. Rather, i would like to have a discussion such as PS vs. Bridge vs. Crop DSLR vs. Full Frame DSLR. I chose mine based on few parameters like sensor size which allows capturing more light, low light performance, cost and D5100 excels in all these parameters.Although i brought the camera with kit lens, i would recommend buying it as body alone and buying a prime lens like 50mm 1.8G or 35mm 1.8G. You will definitely see day-night difference between the image sharpness and quality with these prime lenses. With these lenses you get fantastic bokeh effects at lower aperture values and crisp all rounded images at higher aperture values. And at last, my kit lens (18-55mm) is now lying back on the box it came with, which i should have avoided purchasing so that i would have saved quite few bucks.",

            {
               "body":"Guys, please check your local store for this camera instead of buying it online. The price listed here is around INR 130k which is probably a bit higher than what your local dealer will charge you. Plus there is a flare issue with the D750. So its best to check if your body also has this issue in the shop, though its not easy to produce the same light sources required to reproduce the issue. But you can at least find out if its a bad copy. Because the problem is much more amplified if you have a bad copy & you will need a larger focus micro-adjust for every lens because the AF module's alignment is also a bit off.Here is some more information about the issue:http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-d750/9I wouldn't be too worried, because the issue is minor, and Nikon has issued instructions to service centers to deal with the problem in case you get a bad copy.I would recommend potential buyers to wait it out till the issue has been sorted, or check for a >January 2015 imported camera from your local store if possible to be sure that this issue doesn't affect your camera.This reminds me of the time the D600 was released. The sensor had some issue with dust, so they went ahead and made an entire new camera because of that. I hope they don't go and announce another model because of this minor issue, as it would really disappoint me, and other early adopters. In any case, if some thing like that happens, then the price of the D750 is likely to drop further, to around 110k like the D600, so those who can wait should wait before pulling the trigger on this one.But, if you're here, you already know how good this camera is. I am really happy about this camera, and its price. It beats the Canon 5D mark III in every aspect at almost 60k lesser. How sweet is that? We can get a Tamron 24-70 F2.8 VC for this amount.ATM, I don't think this camera has any competitors at its price point. The AF is super fast, and its high ISO capabilities are just shy of the D4s, which is saying a lot.I like the weather sealing, because you it doesn't have any condensation inside the viewfinder when you go from a chilly room to the outside where its hot and humid. My non-weather sealed cameras would become worthless in such situations, and in the rain when water went inside the viewfinder.Its much lighter than the D4, which is almost double the weight of the D750. On hearing that the D750 has a flippy screen, I was a bit skeptical of its build quality, but it seems that Nikon has done their homework, and it looks pretty reliable. At the very least, I know for sure that I'm not going to be facing the same issues like the swivel screens on the D5xxx series.----------------------D750 vs D800/D810 argument:----------------------I really miss only one thing from the pro cameras from Nikon. Its the 1/8000 shutter speed. The D750 tops out at 1/4000th of a second, and its disappointing, because the D7100 can do 1/8000th of a second at ~60k cheaper. This means that, you always need filters of different sizes for every lens you have in the your bag. This afternoon, I had to stop down to F2.8 while taking portraits so as to not overexpose the scene. I did not have any filters with me, so stopping down was the only way I could get the exposure right.The D810 is much better in this regard. You can shoot at ISO 1/8000th of a second, plus you can also shoot at ISO 64. Which means that you're effectively getting around 1/3rd of a stop less light. So its equal to shooting at ~1/11000th of a second at ISO100. Which means you don't need to stop down to reduce light.The D810 also has a larger buffer, and a faster crop factor shooting frame rate 7fps vs 6.5fps of the D750. Its also better built than the D750. Another thing is that its AF point spread covers more of the frame[which is good for tracking** if you're into sports and that sort of thing]. But the price is much higher too, by about 50-60k for which you can set up your own studio.**Note that though the AF module, though it has a smaller spread than the D810 & D4s, it is actually a bit more sensitive than the D810/D4s, ie it can shoot in 1-2 stops lower light than the most expensive Fx camera from Nikon!Anyways, for the average user 99% of the shots aren't going to be wide aperture portraits in the sun, so you can go for the D750 without any worries. Plus if you think about it, until the D3x/D4, Fx cameras could only go till ISO 200, so what it means is that when you're shooting at ISO 100 at 1/4000th of a second, you're effectively shooting with an exposure value similar to the D3/D3s at ISO 200 and 1/8000th of a second.YOU DON'T NEED 36MP, it only means that you'd be compromising on high ISO shots. The D750 can produce cleaner colors 1 stop better than the D810. The D810 can compensate for noise and detail by oversampling, but it loses color accuracy. Once you lose color accuracy, in skin tones and other colors, you will never get them back unless you spend a ridiculous amount of time in post. This is one of the reasons why the shots out of the D4 and D4s look so much different when compared to other cameras. You'll notice this especially in skin tones when shooting at ISO 6400 and above. So stay away from the D810, and buy the D750. You will not regret it. Its one step closer to the D4s than the D810.---------------------------The D750 vs D7100 argument:---------------------------Now you're tight on budget, you can consider this combo:D7100 + Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 for the same price.Its perfectly fine, the lack of an AA filter in the D7100 gives it the edge in detail, and if you use it with the Sigma, its going to be sharper than the D750 on any FF standard Zoom!!But there are some issues, like the lack of standard focal length lenses, where every lens behaves slightly differently on APS-C bodies. For example, try this: The 24-70mm F2.8 is ~3x zoom, which is like a standard focal length which we normally use, but the 18-35 becomes a 27-52.5mm lens, which isn't that wide, nor does it go close enough. I am kinda hard pressed to recommend it at the same price as that of the Tamron 24-70 F2.8 VC, which is weather sealed, and has a bit more reach. Same is the case with every other lens. Take another example, the 50mm which is a standard lens becomes a portrait lens on the D7100 ie, its equivalent focal length becomes 75mm which is a bit shorter than a 85mm which is usually what people consider as a portrait focal length. So its a bit confusing, you're not sure you really want that focal length in APS-C. Whereas FF is usually a standard affair.But if you're on a budget, I can understand why people might consider this. In fact, its a totally valid option, considering the prices of the lenses in Nikon's FF lens lineup. Most of them are ridiculously priced. Its good that companies like Sigma and Tamron are making use of this market opportunity.-------------------Overall impression:-------------------It was very difficult for me to find any drawbacks in the D750. Overall an excellent camera.-----------------Highly recommend!-----------------",

I'm loving it.The quality of photos are awesome and I prefer capturing images in RAW format which can be edited with Nikon ViewNX software provided with the camera. The RAW format contains full details of the image.Only problem with this camera is movie file. The footage captured is recorded in .mov file which is QuickTime multimedia file format. This file is not recognized by windows movie maker. I've tried a lot on net and downloaded several softwares to convert the file into mp4/avi preferable freewares. mp4 file converted by handbrake is again not recognized by windows movie maker. avi conversion have loss in quality.This is annoying. I could not play the footage in my TV. Nikon should provide a conversion software, else it is costly to convert video files to edit and play. Video quality is just amazing.",

The buttons and other features are a little tightly placed, due to lack of space on the face of the camera. That is it's only drawback. You get used to it within a few hours.

               "body":"D3300 takes beautiful images. I just can't seem to take my hands off it. Now it might be because its pretty new to me, but the images it takes are really beautiful. I would suggest for the person who's buying it, that the kit lens is really good. You would definitely want to buy a 35mm f/1.8 lens(Since its a DX camera its better to go for 35 instead of 50mm) for the Bokeh effect to take great images of objects up close or portraits because the kit lens is not really great at producing bokeh because of the aperture limitations. Bokeh is the effect which makes the background appear blurred out. As an Indian, and if you're someone who's bought an entry level DSLR like this one, definitely go for the other lens for the portraits it will make a huge difference in the photographs you'll take.What the kit lens will do for you, however, is take great images. Honestly 18-55 is rock solid stuff. This lens is really really good and its a steal if you go for the kit lens+body.The video quality is through the roof. For the price I've paid I'm really really satisfied with my camera.Good luck shooting!PS: I'm tagging some photos that I personally took in the last 2 days after I received this camera. These are all in JPEG format.This is the absolute best camera in this price range. Don't think twice about this, just go for it. :)amznJQ.onReady('jQuery', function() {amznJQ.available('popover', function() {var widgetDom = jQuery(\"#R1WGAZ8GK3FRUD_imageSection_ED2EB384-E292-11E4-AF33-9D91F0501C51\");var images = widgetDom.find(\".review-image-thumbnail\");for (var c=0;c<images.length;c++) {var imageURL = jQuery(images[c]).attr(\"large-image-url\");jQuery(images[c]).amazonPopoverTrigger({showOnHover:true,literalContent: '<img src=\"'+ imageURL +'\" style=\"max-width:100%;max-height:100%;\">'});}});});",

               "body":"General Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :\"\"\" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera...\"\"\"So keep learning....",

Many  people  who  don't  know  depth of photography  will suggest  many  people to  go  for  additional  lenses  like  50mm,35mm,70-300,55-200etc... but  the  true  face  is  one  can  do  everything  with  this  kit lens  like ( Portrait,Boekh,Landscape,Low light etc..) Unleash  your  18-55 to  full extend  and  enjoy  it.If  you're  looking  for  bird photography and sports  then  you  will  need  additional Telephoto lens or Zoom lens.Make  sure  you  got  UV filter while  buying  this  cam  cz it  will  protect  your  lens.I  WILL  HIGHLY  RECOMMEND  THIS  CAM  TO  BEGINNERS AND MID LEVEL EXPERTSExperience in amazon:Got  delivered  on  second day  and  it  was  packed  awesome  and  fully  sealed  and latest manufactured product ( Nov 2014).

               "body":"This item is very well packed by amazon shipping. overall item appears new and in sealed pack. But after checking in detail I found some grease /oil/ dust on Lens mirror, that also appears on viewfinder. As a newbie i didn't take any risk to clean it by myself. And this also something I was not expecting from a NEW Camera. So 4/5 star.Took some test images and videos, which came out good. After playing with for a week, here are the things would like to recommend to new buyers to considerRecommendation :18-55mm lens kit is something you need to upgrade instantly (you will notice its limitation just in a week after taking some shots). Must have 50mm prime lens and 18-104mm lens (under 20K budget).Also upgrade to 32GB Class10 SD card. For any HD /RAW files 8GB is very limited. For 8GB you can take max 260 RAW only Images or 30-40 min Video @ 1080 60FPS.Also have Nikon Remote Shutter , which you can get under 200 bucks. Not necessary to go for Branded one.Go for D5300 over D3300 Why?I found that D5300 support HDR and Timer (Time-laps settings) and it has 39 focus pt. All these 3 features really matters to explore some more creativity. Also Fold-able LCD does helps at many case, mostly When you are Recording Videos.Adobe Lightroom 5 supports Nikon DSLR tethering only upto D5XXX series. It doesn't support for D3XXX series. Which is important, because I am more into Product Photography. So Live view helps a lot to get better images, also save time for post processing work.Wifi n GPS does sounds good, but remember theses two are also power hungry. But it also give you some additional feature to control with your Smartphone. If you are a traveler-blogger, Wifi-GPS can give you good experience.So spending on a D5300 body only with 15000 bucks can give you more reliable DSLR camera, that you can use for 2-3 years. I am going to upgrade to D5300 or D5500 in next 2-3 months, So I could have easily save 30 grand , if some mention theses things earlier.-Chinmay",

The sensor is the same, the mega pixel count is the same. Heck D3300 doesn't even have a light filter making each pixel square accept more light. This is advanced DSLR category!I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon. Opted for next day delivery. No probs at all.Went to a 40 day trip to Canada, captured more than 7000 pictures. The images are crisp, color tones perfect, out of the box 'Auto Mode' captures pretty decent (at times even better than manual!) images. Low light performance is also acceptable. Though one needs a bit more practice at low shttee speeds and without a tripod. If you plan to explore night life with this serious camera, you'd definately need a tripod. Otherwise no complains at all. Already feel like I have got my investment's return!I also captured tons of Full HD videos. God the only thing I missed is the image stabilization coz on a 42\" 3D tv the lack of motion soothing is heavily missed. Yet when you know what you're doing, D3300 takes mind boggling videos!The lens along with the kit is the ED VR 18-55 mm Nikkor lens. It does the job perfectly for your day to day photography. But I am just so sure looking at the specs that the D3300 has tons more to offer so planing to by a Prime lens and also a zoom/macro lens in the near future.The party has only just started!",

I would have rated it a 5 on 5 except for some issues-1) when i had ordered the camera it was listed at 28400 or thereabouts. I got the product for 28990. since I have been waiting quite sometime, and the price currently is this, i had no choice but to buy.This means the price you see on ordering may not remain the same as the price you get in delivery which is rather strange.2) the kit clearly says 8 gb card included. the box and all were completely sealed ( i checked them myself) but the memory card is just not there.any help will be sincerely appreciated.for the camera 5/5 (i could give a 6/5 :P)the best camera you could buy for the money. definitely better than the d5200. apart from the extra 1 point dynamic range, it is the same thing as far as sensor and all go. plus you get all the advanced features of the d5200 the most time saving one being the automatic distortion control. just download the latest firmware and it will take in any lens you could possibly put on it.advise is add a uvc filter and invest in a lens hood.the automatic hdr on 5200 is crap. if you really are into HDR photography you will have to take multiple shots and merge them on your computer to get proper effects.same goes for landscape (which the d3300 has and d5200 does not).plus the 3300 takes 700 plus hots compared to the 5200 which takes 500 odd shots (and yes i have used both).if you cant afford a leica, or if you are cagey about buying the fuji x, this is the smallest, lightest camera with no oplf filter (sharper images) that you can buy India for under 30000 for street photography. Pair it up with a 35mm 1.8 nikon for more light control. 5fps shooting is more than enough unless you are doing very serious sports photography.",

I bought this cam few days back from amazon because it came as a deal here and sold pretty cheap comparing to the other sites. Before buying the cam I've researched about DSLR and what would be the best fit on my pocket over the net and according to many sites and experts NIKON D3300 is the new best in the league of entry level DSLRs. I'm not going to the pro's and con's because first of all, I'm not a specialist on this field and secondly, there are lots of youtube videos and sites about this cam review and I guess they know far better than me.Only a few things what I've noticed in this short period of usage are :i. Good color depth and stunning picsii. Easy to useiii. Lighter than the other sibling and rival DSLRs of this rangeiv. Comes with additional features and modesv. The other accessories provided with the cam are pretty handy [Except the charger. I still can't understand why the charger comes into two attachable pieces. It will be easier to use if it comes as one body]Apart from these I've heard about a issue regarding the genuine product, dealer stamp on the warranty papers etc. Well, I've got the warranty papers but there are no dealer stamps. I don't know if it will become a big issue while claiming the warranty or not. But I took that risk and the product is actually a genuine one. What I've got is the bill paper from the seller i.e amazon and I guess that will be enough to claim the warranty along with the genuine warranty papers and numbers [ You can verify the number written on the warranty paper by matching it with the number written on the lens ].Just wanna say, great job amazon. It would cost me more if I bought this cam from outlets of Nikon or other sites. But amazon gave me a good deal.I got it at around 26.5K with a lens and at 24% discount. So, go for it if you have <= that price. Even if not, you can spend around 28-29K with eyes closed. Just go for it.",

It produces good quality, highly detailed JPEGs and those who are so inclined will find lots of latitude for adjusting Raw files. Like its predecessor, the D5300's Raw files allow shadows to be opened up without introducing too much in the way of noise. Default JPEG rendering is also pleasant, without any over-sharpening halo artifacts.The D5300's video quality is just as notable as its still image quality. It offers full 1080/60p resolution, available without the crop mode that the D7100 applies to its highest resolution videos. As a result the D5300's video is more detailed and motion is smooth. With the ability to output Raw video over HDMI and plug in an external microphone, the D5300 is well worth consideration as a beginning videographer's camera or a cheap secondary camera for a pro.The bottom line is that you can't argue with 24 megapixels of AA-filter-less resolution. The D5300 delivers excellent image quality - slightly better than its various kit lenses are actually capable of rendering, it seems. In that regard, it's a great option for someone who wants to start with the kit and eventually add better glass.If you're looking for a DSLR and want something approachable yet serious, but not quite as pro as the D7100, the D5300 is an excellent option. It won't let anyone in this category down in terms of image or video quality. Absolute beginners can happily shoot away in Auto, and those who are a little more hands-on will find all of their basic exposure controls relatively easy to access. It's not the fine-tuned, semi-pro instrument that the D7100 is, but its image quality could lead you to believe otherwise.",

               "body":"For last 5 years I've been learning photography using an advanced point and shoot camera Canon SX110 IS and since last 8 months had started to feel the need of upgrading to an D-SLR now. I read lots of reviews and tested different D-SLRs during this period. One thing came out certain was Nikon has far better D-SLRs than Canon in terms of image quality considering the cameras in the same price range.I finally arrived between selecting D7100 and D5300. I used D7100 for 10 days and clicked lots of images with it. Awesome performance no doubt. However, when using D5300, this camera too gave the exact same level of Image Quality of D7100 and awesome quality it is. For any person whose hobby is photography, I believe Image Quality is the most important point. Rest of things like LCD display, Wifi, GPS, etc... don't even count.Sure, D7100 gives you extra buttons so that you can configure your shot far more faster than on D5300, and few other features, but considering that D5300 is hell lot cheaper than D7100... makes one wonder. And also one needs to consider the cost of additional lenses in the future.So here are the advantages of D5300,1. Image quality that is at par with D71002. Video recording at 1080p / 60 fps (Great to have slow motion effect)2. Lesser weight and more portable (Guess because the removed the built in auto-focus motor)3. The Wifi helps to use your smartphone as a remote. This is great to take shots without shaking the cameraThere are no disadvantages as such, however, you need to know the limitations of this camera,1. There is no built in focus motor. So your lens needs to have the focusing motor built in. Not such a big problem, but one should be aware about this.2. Only one Function button and no additional buttons to change white balance, ISO, etc. So in D5300 you need to press the 'i' button and then use the menu d-pad and select the option to change these settings. Time consuming however with practice the time to change these values can be improved.3. You cannot change aperture in Live View. Now this is a little issue and hoping that Nikon fixes this through a camera firmware update.4. No weather sealing. One key advantage of D7100 is that it has weather protection. D5300 does not. So one needs to be extra carefulBottom line, if you earn money through your photography, then go buy the D7100 or D610 (a full frame sensor camera).If you just enjoy photography as a hobby and you save your hard-earned money like me to buy camera and lenses then buy the D5300, you will not be disappointed.If you have a lot of money, then go ahead and buy D7100 or even D610",

               "body":"The product is as good as advertised (of course my careful scrutiny of many reviews online helped)Wonderful camera, Used it for three weeks and quite worth it, I feel, especially along with the 18-140mm lens kit, which is much better than my previous kit where i had to shift back and forth between an 18-55mm and 55-200mm. The time spent changing lenses make me miss the shot, especially when travelling, where most environments are not ideal to detach the lens and expose the sensor.The built in wifi and the GPS drain the battery fast, if in use, so keep a close eye, or dont turn them on, especially GPS, unless you have a spare battery.Highly recommend if you can afford it.",

Vari-angle TFT Monitor : you need not be on your knees even for ground/ child shots.2. Absence of Low Pass Filter : resultant highly sharp images3. In built Wi-Fi : Control this camera with smart phone. Live view, focus and click images with mobile. Instant download to mobile directly from camera. No need to go back to your system to upload pics on social site. just click and upload.4. Best color capture in images5. It works best with Nikon AF-S 50mm prime lens. Best for portraits. (You can simply skip buying to kit lens i.e. Nikon 18-55mm cause once you work with prime lens you will never gonna use kit lens)6. 24 MP Sensor : Even after cropping images in ur system it gives superb results cause 24MP is more then we need. So once you capture a moment it help in retouch.",

               "body":"It has been just a couple of days that I have purchased this DSLR camera from Amazon. Nikon has really excelled in its ergonomics of camera design (especially deep and good hand grip) by introducing Nikon D5300 in mid range level DSLR camera class. As a beginner to field of photography I was searching the best DSLR to start with good features and build quality which wouldn't burn a hole in my pocket. Initially I thought of going for D3300 but then after a bit research and taking opinions from friend (who is a photographer), I finally focused on Nikon D5300 and was impressed with so many features under its hood compared to that of Nikon D3300. Clearly this camera has pros such as 39 auto focus points, Wifi and Gps capability, Expeed 4 image processing chip used, video recording capability in 1080p 60fps and many more.... however I haven't faced any problems with it in order to write cons about it. But I must say I am very happy with my D5300 and hope to learn photography through iti am big fan of Nikon D5300.....",

This monster can, take pics at par wherein professional Flim Industry use high end DSLRs. Infact in some bollywood movies, D5300 is used recording the cinemas.Now regarding Amazon, I must say, delivery time is extremely good & much before than the expected time. The quality of material/ packaging & people involved in shipment/ dispatch was fabulous & very polite. In totality, I am very happy & satisfied with dealings through Amazon. Since I am a regular purchaser from Amazon, so the shipment quality/ people involved in deliveries, can be treated as a gross feedback from my end. However, this in turn presets a very high expectations from Amazon, so benchmarking would be tough going forward.... !!!!!!",
